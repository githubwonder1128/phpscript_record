Bio

Hello, there!

As an experienced Blockchain & Full Stack developer, I can provide you amazing service with my solid technical skills and communication skills.

I have deep knowledge in DeFi, Dex, Bridge, NFT Marketplace, NFT Minting, NFT staking, and Centeralized Exchange.
And I have developed many full stack dapps from scratch using React.js and Vue.js.

Especially I like game development very much and implemented NFT marketplace to the games such as Nostal games.

I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays. That's why I chose freelancing as my career because I am confident that I am good at this field and I am never afraid of doing hard work.

I am sure that if you hire me, I will present many successful projects with minimal efforts from your side.

Please hire me.
